# Data structure and algorithmns

- The main purpose of creating this repository is to bring awareness and better build of the  **Data Structures**.

> various types of data structures are implemented in `c` and `TypeScript` language.

## Types of Data Structures

Each data structures code is in a subfolder under [src](https://github.com/codenuru/algorithms/tree/master/src). Each folder consists of several files associated with the data structure. several implementations of the same data structure has been made with different sources.

1) [`LINKED LIST`](https://github.com/codenuru/algorithms/tree/master/src/linkedList)
2) [`STACK`](<https://github.com/codenuru/algorithms/tree/master/src/stack>)
3) [`QUEUE`](<https://github.com/codenuru/algorithms/tree/master/src/queue>)
4) [`TREES`](<https://github.com/codenuru/algorithms/tree/master/src/trees>)
5) [`GRAPHS`](<https://github.com/codenuru/algorithms/tree/master/src/graphs>)

## Algorithms

1) [`Sorting Algorithms`](https://github.com/codenuru/algorithms/tree/master/src/sortingAlgorithms)
