# Numerical Analysis Algorithms

Numerical analysis algorithms are a collection of mathematical algorithms and techniques used to solve problems involving numerical computations. These algorithms aim to approximate solutions for mathematical problems that may be too complex or time-consuming to solve exactly.

Various numerical analysis algorithms exist for different types of problems, such as solving equations, finding roots, performing numerical integration, optimizing functions, and solving systems of linear equations. Here are explanations of some common numerical analysis algorithms:

1. Newton's Method: This algorithm is used to find the roots (or zeros) of a function. It starts with an initial guess and iteratively refines the guess to approach the actual root by using tangent lines to the function.

2. Bisection Method: This algorithm is used to find roots of a function within a specified interval. It works by repeatedly bisecting the interval and narrowing down the range where the root lies.

3. Gaussian Elimination: This algorithm is used to solve systems of linear equations. It transforms the system into an equivalent upper triangular system using row operations, which can then be easily solved.

4. Simpson's Rule: This algorithm is used for numerical integration, approximating the area under a curve. It divides the integration interval into smaller subintervals and approximates the curve within each subinterval using quadratic interpolation.

5. Gradient Descent: This algorithm is used for optimization problems. It aims to find the minimum of a function by iteratively updating the current solution in the direction of steepest descent.

6. Runge-Kutta Methods: These algorithms are used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). They approximate solutions by considering slope values at various points within a given interval.

7. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): This algorithm efficiently computes the discrete Fourier transform of a sequence of values. It is commonly used in signal processing and spectrum analysis.

## Fast inverse square root

The inverse square root of a floating point number is used in digital signal processing to normalize a vector, scaling it to length 1 to produce a unit vector.
